# ESP Pilot
ESP32 based Flight Controller for multirotor aircraft

I'm using Arduino libraries which are not included in this repository, so the project does not build OOB right now.

Documentation about configuration and details will be here, presumably not very soon as I'm the only maintainer :)

Currently supports:
- PWM receivers
- PWM controlled ESC's
- MPU6050 based IMU's
